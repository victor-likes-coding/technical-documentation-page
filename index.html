<!-- 
completed: User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

completed: User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.

completed: User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

completed: User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

completed: User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

completed User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

completed: User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

completed: User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

completed: User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

completed: User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

completed User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

completed: User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").

completed: User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

          Welcome to my Technical Documents project from FreeCodeCamp. I aim to
          create a web document that will serve as a docs page for introductory
          javascript (minimally necessary to pass the coding challenge, because
          realistically, you don't get paid more to do more work).
        </p>

        <p>
          Some topics we'll cover are: Variables, Data Types, Conditional
          Statements, Loops, and Functions. Please hold onto your
          seats as we set out on our journey to learn a bit about Javascript.
        </p>

          is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming
          language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as
          the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
          also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
          JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
          dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
          declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>One of the very first things you must know about JavaScript is that it uses variables like most other languages. When thinking about variables, think of a bucket, or a box. The bucket or box will contain something inside of it. You name the bucket/box so that you can then reference it later when you need what is in the container. Look below:</p>
        <code class="block">const cookie = 5;</code>
        <p>In that statement, or expression, I've set the word cookie to have a value of 5. In English, you'd say something like, set the word cookie to equal 5. Now when I want to use it, I call cookie. Calling it is simply typing the word like so: <code>cookie * 5</code>. What's happening is JavaScript won't know what cookie is, so it goes up a chain and tries to find some meaning. It ends up understanding that cookie is 5 so the expression goes from <code>cookie * 5</code> to <code>5 * 5</code>. It might not make a whole lot of sense now, but variables are very important. </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>In the previous section, we talked about variables. Variables are just words we use to store some value. Variables can hold all sorts of things, but they're categorized into distinct types. Some of those types are in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strings</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>undefined</li>
          <li>BigInt</li>
          <li>Symbols</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Strings are just letters and characters that goes between quotes, single or double. <code>"A"</code> is the same as <code>'A'</code>. They're literals, meaning what you put in between the quotes is literally what you'll see (most of the time).</p>

      <p>Numbers involve strictly numbers. Floats such as decimal numbers, and integers such as big rounded numbers without decimals. Some examples of integers: <code>11 50 100 999</code>, and floats: <code>1.11 1.34 55.51</code></p>

      <p>Booleans are either true or false. In JavaScript, they're represented as <code>true/false</code>.</p>

      <p>To the extent that I will do the minimal amount of work to get this project done, I will skip undefined, BigInt, and Symbols.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Statements">
        <header>Conditional Statements</header>
        <code></code>
        <p>A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: <code>if...else</code> and <code>switch</code>.</p>
        <p>An <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p>

        <code class='block'>if (condition) { <br>
          &emsp;statement_1; <br>
        } else { <br>
          &emsp;statement_2; <br>
        }</code>

        <p>Here, the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. If condition evaluates to true, <code>statement_1</code> is executed. Otherwise, <code>statement_2</code> is executed. <code>statement_1</code> and <code>statement_2</code> can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
        <code class='block'>for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) { <br>
          &emsp;// Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4. <br>
          &emsp;console.log('Walking east one step'); <br>
        }</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
